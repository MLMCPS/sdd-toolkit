  Shared CLAUDE.md sections from the sdd-toolkit plugin — merge into each service's CLAUDE.md.
  Loaded on EVERY session in every repo that adopts it, so every line is paid for continuously:
  keep only what is specific to this toolkit or this project. The full coding contract lives in
  the plugin's `coder` agent, which carries it when it runs; don't restate it here.

## Knowledge layer — indexing, retrieval, summaries

These docs load into context, so load the **least** that answers the task, in this order:

0. **`CLAUDE.md` (this file)** — always in context, so it stays a thin index: stack one-liner,
   build/test/lint commands, and links. It points; it never inlines.
1. **`docs/PATTERNS.md`** — when writing/changing code (skip for Q&A or trivial edits). New code
   MUST match it. In a monorepo, read only the relevant package's section.
2. **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — when you need to find where something lives. Read the relevant
   section, not the file. If **sharded**, it's a router: read it, then only your module's shard.
3. **`docs/ESTATE.md`** — only when the task touches an event or a cross-service call. Generated
   by `/sdd-estate`; don't hand-maintain it.
4. **Agentic retrieval last** — `Explore` / grep / glob, for exact lines only.

**Token discipline:** cite `file:line` rather than pasting code; read file *ranges* once a summary
says where to look; never re-read a doc already in context.

Sharded docs, interlinked modules, or a change crossing a module/service boundary? Load the
sdd-toolkit **`knowledge-retrieval`** skill for that procedure — and not otherwise.

**Keep summaries fresh** (`/sdd-refresh`) after changing endpoints, listeners, external clients, or
data-access flavor. A stale summary is worse than none.

## Working agreement (coding-agent contract)

The full contract lives in the plugin's `coder` agent. What binds *all* work here:

1. **Inspect before assuming** structure or stack — the code is the source of truth and overrides
   any default you'd otherwise reach for.
2. **Smallest correct change**, matching the surrounding file's naming, layering, error handling
   and tests. Reuse what's there; justify any new dependency or abstraction.
3. **ASK rather than guess on contracts** — API shape, data model or migration, error/status codes,
   scope boundary, compatibility. A guessed contract costs more to undo than to ask about.

**Quality gates (run this repo's real commands — never invent them):** test (unit + integration +
functional/E2E), lint, and typecheck, filled in below; final acceptance runs the full suite end to
end. Schema changes ship as **migrations** or schema/index updates, never hand edits. Secrets come
from env.

<!-- /sdd-init fills the real commands for this repo, e.g.:
- Test: `npm test` / `mvn test` / `pytest` …
- Lint/format: `npm run lint` / `./gradlew spotlessCheck` …
- Typecheck: `tsc --noEmit` … -->

## Spec-driven development

Non-trivial changes start with a reviewable spec, not code. See `specs/README.md`. The loop:
`/spec <ticket>` → human reviews → `/spec-advance … Approved` → `/spec-build` (test-first, one
functional/E2E test per user-facing criterion) → `/spec-verify` (adversarial + full suite green,
§6.1) → `/code-review` → `/spec-advance … Verified` → `/pr` → merge → `/spec-advance … Archived`.

Status is only ever written by `/spec-advance`, which refuses a transition whose evidence isn't
there. `/sdd-status` shows the board; `/sdd-doctor` flags statuses the repo can't back up.

Anything not in the approved spec is out of scope — update the spec first. Trivial one-line fixes
are exempt: `/code` for those, `/spec` when a change touches an API, data model, event, or several
files. (`/code-review` and `/security-review` are built-in Claude Code commands.)

## Git & PR workflow

- **Branch** off the default branch; never commit straight to it. Follow the repo's existing branch
  naming (e.g. `feature/TICKET-slug`). Commits are small, focused, present-tense imperative, and
  keep the spec in the same branch/PR as its implementation.
- **Before a PR:** quality gates pass, `/code-review` is clean, every acceptance criterion has a
  passing test. Don't commit secrets, generated artifacts, or unrelated reformatting.
- **No AI attribution anywhere in the history.** Commit messages, commit trailers, PR titles and
  PR bodies name the humans who own the change and nothing else. Never add a `Co-Authored-By:`
  line for an assistant, a "Generated with"/"Made with" line, a model or vendor name, or a
  tool badge or emoji. A `Co-Authored-By:` trailer is only ever a real teammate. This holds for
  every commit on the branch, not just the last one — a squash merge aggregates trailers from
  all of them, so one stray line resurfaces on the merge commit.
- Only commit or push when the human asks; surface the diff for review first.
